Introduction Summary: 
The product we have built is an app called iLost. iLost is an app that allows users to post items that have been lost and connect with others to relocate their lost items. It provides users with a reliable place to turn to. Our search bar feature that filters posts for an easy look-up and the ability to upload pictures of the item helps users find their lost items fast.

Technical Architecture: 
Using React for the frontend of our website, we included features for displaying existing posts, a working search bar, and the function to upload a new post detailing a lost item found. The frontend is coded in JavaScript for React, and the styling is coded in CSS. We also implemented a ReactJS library. All of these features are supported by our Flask backend written in Python.
