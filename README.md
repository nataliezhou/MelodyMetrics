# Technical Architecture: 
The frontend of MelodyMetrics deals with all user interactions and what the user sees on the website page. Using React for the frontend, we included features for displaying listening visualizations and tabs for different metrics. The frontend is coded in JavaScript for React, the website structure is built partly with HTML, and the styling is coded in CSS. We used the ReactJS library to implement most frontend features. All of these features are supported by our Node.js backend written in JS, which handles and stores the data.

The frontend and backend interact through REST API requests, and we used GET and POST requests to fetch and store data between the frontend and the backend mock database.
